### Step 2:  Open the folder, and then open "el-proyecte-grande" folder.

### Step 3:  Open el-proyecte-grande.sln.sln in Visual Studio.

### step 3.1:  Open the Package Manager console in VS and enter the command `dotnet restore`, this is to install all the nuGet Packages.

### step 4:  Open Visual Studio Code in the "el-proyecte-grande" folder.

### Step 5.1:  Open a terminal with `ctrl` + ``` ` ```.

### Step 5.2:  In the recently opened terminal enter `cd client-app`, this is to navigate into the folder where React is located.

### Step 5.3:  Now, in the terminal enter the command `npm install`, this will install all the necessary node modules.

### Step 6:  Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code ( `ctrl` + ``` ` ```), enter `cd API` to navigate into the backend project, now enter `dotnet watch run`, this starts the Server

### Step 7:  Back to the terminal opened in step 5, enter `npm start`. Now in a few moments a browser will tart with the application (if you closed that terminal, you can redo from step 5, but instead of `npm install`, write `npm start`)
